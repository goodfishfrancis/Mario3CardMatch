- Each turn consists of 2 card flips

- If the Second card you flip matches the first, you have made a match and your match combo multiplier goes up by 1

- If you don't make a match, both cards are flipped back - this is a "miss" and your combo multiplier is set back to zero

- After two misses, your points and combo multiplier for the round are reset and all cards are flipped back

- Win a round by successfully matching all cards without missing twice. After winning continue to the next 
round with the points from the previous round.

- New round resets combo multiplier
