# Mario3CardMatch
Card Match game From Mario Bros 3


Each turn consists of 2 card flips

If the Second card you flip matches the first, you have made a match and your match combo multiplier goes up by 1

If you don't make a match, both cards are flipped back - this is a "miss" and your combo multiplier is set back to zero

After two misses, your points and combo multiplier for the round are reset and all cards are flipped back

Win a round by successfully matching all cards without missing twice. After winning continue to the next 
round with the points from the previous round. 

# WARNING 
Pressing Reset will reset all progress. 

Match Values: Mushroom - 1, Flower = 2, Star = 5, 1up = 7, 10coin = 10, 20coin = 20
